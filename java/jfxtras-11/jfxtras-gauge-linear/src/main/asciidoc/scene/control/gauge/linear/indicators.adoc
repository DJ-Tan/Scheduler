Indicators can be assigned to these position as follows:
[source,java]
--
    gauge.indicators().add(new Indicator(0, "warning"));
    gauge.indicators().add(new Indicator(1, "error"));
--

This enables (but does not show!) the indicator at the corresponding locations, the example uses the two predefined indicators "error" and "warning".
Indicators can be made visible by assigning "visible" to the corresponding -fxx-INDICATORID-indicator-visibility variable in CSS, like so:
[source,css]
--
    -fxx-warning-indicator-visibility: visible; 
    -fxx-error-indicator-visibility: visible;
--

It is possible to have indicators become visible based on the needle's value, by means of the segments.
Suppose the needle is over segment1, then a CSS class named "segment1-active" is added to the node.
Using this CSS class an indicator can be made visible, for example:
[source,css]
--
   .segment1-active {
       -fxx-warning-indicator-visibility: visible; 
    }
   .segment2-active {
       -fxx-error-indicator-visibility: visible; 
    }
--
Segments may overlap and can be transparent, there is a special "colorscheme-first-grey-rest-transparent-10" colorscheme.
Segments could be setup solely to show indicators, for example segment1 could run from 50% to 100% and segment2 from 75% to 100%.
If the needle is over segment2, both the warning and error indicator will be visible.

=== Example (using the CSS above)
[source,java]
--
    gauge.getStyleClass().add("colorscheme-first-grey-rest-transparent-10");
    gauge.segments().add(new CompleteSegment(gauge));
    gauge.segments().add(new PercentSegment(gauge, 50.0, 100.0, "warningSegment"));
    gauge.segments().add(new PercentSegment(gauge, 75.0, 100.0, "errorSegment"));
--

Given that the segements have id's, you can also use active classes based on these id's: 
[source,css]
--
   .segment-warningSegment-active {
       -warning-indicator-visibility: visible; 
    }
   .segment-errorSegment-active {
       -error-indicator-visibility: visible; 
    }
--

This should not be confused with the CSS rules based on the id of the segments (in the example: #warningSegment and #errorSegment).

Custom indicators can be created in CSS by defining a 100x100 SVG shape in CSS, with 0,0 being in the center, and assign an id to it. Similar to the default error indicator:.
[source,css]
--
   .error-indicator {
       visibility: -fxx-error-indicator-visibility;
       -fx-background-color: -fxx-error-indicator-color;
       -fx-shape: 'M-50,0 a50,50 0 1,0 100,0 a50,50 0 1,0 -100,0'; 
       -fx-scale-shape: false; 
   }
--
