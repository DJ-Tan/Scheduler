/**
 * UNTIL:
 * RFC 5545 iCalendar 3.3.10, page 41
 * 
 * The UNTIL rule part defines a DATE or DATE-TIME value that bounds
 * the recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If the value
 * specified by UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence,
 * this DATE or DATE-TIME becomes the last instance of the
 * recurrence.  The value of the UNTIL rule part MUST have the same
 * value type as the "DTSTART" property.  Furthermore, if the
 * "DTSTART" property is specified as a date with local time, then
 * the UNTIL rule part MUST also be specified as a date with local
 * time.  If the "DTSTART" property is specified as a date with UTC
 * time or a date with local time and time zone reference, then the
 * UNTIL rule part MUST be specified as a date with UTC time.  In the
 * case of the "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components the UNTIL
 * rule part MUST always be specified as a date with UTC time.  If
 * specified as a DATE-TIME value, then it MUST be specified in a UTC
 * time format.  If not present, and the COUNT rule part is also not
 * present, the "RRULE" is considered to repeat forever
