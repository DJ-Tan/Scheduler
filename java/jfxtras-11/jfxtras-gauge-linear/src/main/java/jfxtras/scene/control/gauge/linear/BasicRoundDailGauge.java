/**
 * = BasicArcGauge
 * 
 * This gauge is a simple semi-real round gauge, featuring an outer ring with shade effect, ticks with labels, a big textual version of the current indicated value and a long slender needle.
 * The needle moves through an arc ranging from about 7 o'clock (min) clockwise to 5 o'clock (max).
 * 
 * == Standard CSS properties
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/cssProperties.adoc[]
 * 
 * == Additional CSS properties
 * The gauge supports the following additional CSS styleable properties:
 * 
 * - -fxx-tick-color: the color used to draw the ticks on the face plate
 * 
 * == Colors and colorschemes
 * The gauge is able to draw in different colors, by specifying values for the following CSS selectors:
 * 
 * - -fxx-backplate-color
 * - -fxx-needle-color
 * - -fxx-tick-color
 * - -fxx-value-color
 * - -fxx-knob-color 
 * - -fxx-tick-color
 * 
 * A few ready-to-use colors are available through colorscheme's:
 * 
 * - colorscheme-light
 * - colorscheme-dark
 * - colorscheme-green
 * - colorscheme-red
 *
 * === Example
 * [source,java]
 * --
 *     final BasicArcGauge lBasicArcGauge = new BasicArcGauge();
 *     lBasicArcGauge.getStyleClass().add("colorscheme-green");
 * --
 * Note: these colorscheme's co-exist with the segment's colorscheme's.
 * 
 * == Labels
 * This gauge per default has percentage labels starting at 0%, stepping up 10% up to and including 100%.
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/labels.adoc[]
 * 
 * == Segments
 * This gauge supports segments, which are colored parts of the arc rendered behind the ticks, over which the needle moves:
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/segments.adoc[]
 * Note: these colorscheme's co-exist with the needle's colorscheme's.
 * 
 * == Marker
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/markers.adoc[]
 * Note: Marker colors are also set in the colorschemes.
 *
 * == Indicators
 * This gauge has six indicators positions: 0 up to and including 5, located around the knob.
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/indicators.adoc[]
 * 
 * == Segment colorscheme
 * include::src/main/asciidoc/scene/control/gauge/linear/segmentsColorscheme.adoc[]
 *  
 * == Disclaimer
 * This is a blatant but approved visual copy of Gerrit Grunwald's Enzo RadialSteel (https://bitbucket.org/hansolo/enzo/src).
